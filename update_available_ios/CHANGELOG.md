## 2.2.1

- Update package_info_plus to 3.0.1

## 2.1.0

- Replace `package_info`, which is deprecated, with `package_info_plus`

## 2.0.0

- *Null-safety* bump to stable
- Dependencies versions bump

**Disclaimer:** I think that it's correctly working, but as I am not using *null-safety* in production yet, I couldn't propertly test it. **@ashishbeck** [thinks it's OK to be published as *stable*](https://github.com/mateusfccp/update_available/issues/5#issuecomment-797945264), so I am doing it. If you find any issue, please report.

## 2.0.0-nullsafety

- Migration to *null-safety*
- Changed `version` to `pub_semver`

**Disclaimer:** I think that it's correctly working, but as I am not using *null-safety* in production yet, I couldn't propertly test it. I am going to ask to someone to test it for me and, as soon it's safe to be used in production, I publish it as stable.
